## Topic: Impact of psychological capital on student's engagement and performance at universities in Ho Chi Minh City.

These are the components of my research at the university. I worked as a data analyst, responsible for gathering, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.

The datasets are gathered by surveys. 

After eliminating unsatisfactory samples, my team and I decided to collect 525 samples for "Young Economist 2019" and 895 samples for "Eureka 2019".
