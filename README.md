## Topic: Impact of psychological capital on student's engagement and performance at universities in Ho Chi Minh City.

These are the components of my research at the university. I worked as a data analyst, responsible for gathering, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.

The datasets are gathered by surveys. 

After eliminating unsatisfactory samples, my team and I decided to collect 525 samples for "Young Economist 2019" and 895 samples for "Eureka 2019".

My Eureka research was published [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OTXpAeVf1gN-Ukf0iv93hcoVStMsDT6x/view) on page 191.
